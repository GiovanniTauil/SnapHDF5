# snapinfo_hdf5.py:

Repository Description:

This repository contains a Python script for extracting and printing information about GADGET HDF5 snapshots. The script allows you to view particle counts, time, and data for various particle components in the snapshot.

# snapinfo_parttype.py:

Repository Description:

Explore GADGET HDF5 snapshots with this Python script. Extract details for a specific particle type (PartType0, PartType1, etc.) and gain insights into the data distribution, such as particle positions and velocities.

# snapshot_copy_hdf5.py:

Repository Description:

This repository includes a Python script to create new GADGET HDF5 snapshots by copying data from an existing snapshot. Use this script to duplicate snapshot data while preserving the original structure and attributes.

# shift_to_com_hdf5.py:

Repository Description:

Shift particle positions and velocities to the center of mass with this Python script for GADGET HDF5 snapshots. Correct for bulk motion effects and create modified snapshots with adjusted coordinates and velocities.

# DensityPeakShift.py:

Repository Description:

Utilize this Python script to compute particle densities, find density peaks, and adjust particle positions and velocities accordingly. Designed for GADGET HDF5 snapshots, this script helps center data around density peaks.
